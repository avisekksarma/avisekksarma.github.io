    <h1>👋 Hi, I’m Abhishek Sharma</h1>
    <p>
      Software Engineer | Backend & AI
    </p>
    <p>
      I love building scalable systems and intelligent applications that combine <strong>backend engineering</strong> with <strong>applied AI</strong>.<br>
      Currently I am working as a Software Engineer (Backend) in a startup [ZeroTB](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zerotb/) where I am responsible for building backend apps, software infrastructure, software design, handling database related all tasks including data migration, optimizing queries, thereby taking ownership of core features for making a AI-powered compliance agent platform to help mainly US based startups to get compliant without hassle.<br>
      Before that, I worked as a Python/ML Engineer at [Docsumo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/docsumoai/) where I mainly worked on core text and omr extraction packages and models, i.e. Docsumo helps clients to remove manual paperwork and instead use document AI to extract important info from client documents and automate their workflows, and I worked on the maintaining, improving of that very extraction logic that drives the platform.
